This repo contains the Pirouette bindings for OSX and iOS frameworks, and will contain Sample projects
in the future.

It does not contain the native driver code.  For that you need to download [the Pirouette package](eventual url here) or
check things out from the [the EchoJS github repo](https://github.com/toshok/echo-js), which contains and builds these
bindings.
